# Solar

A Python implementation of orbital mechanics with gravitational forces, featuring realistic physics simulation and visualization.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Implements Newton's law of universal gravitation
- **Multiple Bodies**: Support for N-body gravitational interactions
- **Stable Integration**: Uses Verlet integration for accurate orbital mechanics
- **Visualization**: 2D plotting with trajectory tracking
- **Energy Conservation**: Tracks orbital energy and angular momentum
- **Customizable**: Easy to create custom celestial body systems


### Gravitational Force
The simulator implements Newton's law of universal gravitation:
```
F = G * m1 * m2 / r²
```

Where:
- G = 6.67430e-11 m³/kg/s² (gravitational constant)
- m1, m2 = masses of the two bodies
- r = distance between bodies


## Features

- simulation itself

- educational things quiz blah blah
