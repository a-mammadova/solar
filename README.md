# Solar

A Python implementation of orbital mechanics with gravitational forces, featuring realistic physics simulation and visualization.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Implements Newton's law of universal gravitation
- **Visualization**: plotting with trajectory tracking
- **Educational thingies**: 


### Gravitational Force
The simulator implements Newton's law of universal gravitation:
```
F = G * m1 * m2 / r²
```

Where:
- G = 6.67430e-11 m³/kg/s² (gravitational constant)
- m1, m2 = masses of the two bodies
- r = distance between bodies


## Features

- simulation itself

- educational things quiz blah blah
